# KerbalTherapist
An external program to generate Kerbals
About:
KerbalTherapist is a third party app that allows you to create Kerbals either singly or in large batches. It was designed because I was tired of never having enough kerbals available that fit my mission parameters, and I'm not patient enough to wait for the game to dynamically generate the Kerbal that I need right now.
KerbalTherapist can be found at https://www.github.com/kamaia/KerbalGenerator/releases and as of the time of this writing is in Beta.
